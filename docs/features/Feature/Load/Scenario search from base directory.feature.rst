Feature: Feature files search is started from base directory
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

By default, pytest-bdd-ng will use current module's path as base path
for finding feature files, but this behaviour can be changed in the
pytest configuration file (i.e. ``pytest.ini``, ``tox.ini`` or
``setup.cfg``) by declaring the new base path in the
``bdd_features_base_dir`` key. The path is interpreted as relative to
the pytest root directory. You can also override features base path on a
per-scenario basis, in order to override the path for specific tests.

Background:
           

- Given File "Passing.feature" in the temporary path with content:

  .. code:: gherkin

     Feature: Passing feature
       Scenario: Passing scenario
         Given Passing step
       Scenario: Failing scenario
         Given Failing step

- And File "conftest.py" with content:

  .. code:: python

     from pytest_bdd import step
     from pytest_bdd.compatibility.pytest import fail

     @step('Passing step')
     def _():
       ...

     @step('Failing step')
     def _():
       fail('Intentional')

- And File "test_feature.py" with content:

  .. code:: python

     from pytest_bdd import scenarios

     test = scenarios('Passing.feature')

Scenario:
         

- Given File "pytest.ini" with fixture templated content:

  .. code:: ini

     [pytest]
     bdd_features_base_dir={tmp_path}

- When run pytest

- Then pytest outcome must contain tests with statuses:

  ====== ======
  passed failed
  ====== ======
  1      1
  ====== ======
