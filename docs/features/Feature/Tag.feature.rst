Feature: Features could be tagged
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For picking up tests to run we can use
``tests selection <http://pytest.org/latest/usage.html#specifying-tests-selecting-tests>``\ \_
technique. The problem is that you have to know how your tests are
organized, knowing only the feature files organization is not enough.
``cucumber tags <https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Tags>``\ \_
introduces standard way of categorizing your features and scenarios

Background:
           

- Given File "Passed.feature" with content:

  .. code:: gherkin

     @passed
     Feature: Steps are executed by corresponding step keyword decorator
       Scenario: Passed
         Given I produce passed test

- Given File "Failed.feature" with content:

  .. code:: gherkin

     @failed
     Feature: Steps are executed by corresponding step keyword decorator
       Scenario: Failed
         Given I produce failed test

- Given File "Both.feature" with content:

  .. code:: gherkin

     @both
     Feature: Steps are executed by corresponding step keyword decorator
       Scenario: Passed
         Given I produce passed test

Scenario:
