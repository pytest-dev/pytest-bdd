# Feature: Gherkin steps bounding to steps definitions
## Scenario: Steps are executed by corresponding step keyword decorator
* Given File "steps.feature" with content:
    ```gherkin
    Feature: Steps are executed by corresponding step keyword decorator

      Scenario:
          Step execution definitions are pytest fixtures by their nature
          and are stored at pytest "conftest.py" files (or any other place
          where pytest fixtures could be placed)

          * Step is executed by plain step decorator
          Given Step is executed by given step decorator
          When Step is executed by when step decorator
          Then Step is executed by then step decorator

          Then there are passed steps by kind:
            |step|given|when|then|
            |   1|    1|   1|   1|
    ```
* And File "conftest.py" with content:
    ```python
    from pytest_bdd import given, when, then, step
    from pytest import fixture

    # pytest fixtures could be used from step definitions, so some
    # test preconditions could be stored on the pytest level
    @fixture
    def step_counter():
      yield {'step': 0, 'given': 0,'when': 0,'then': 0,}

    # Step with any kind of keyword could be bounded to step decorated with "step" definition
    @step('Step is executed by plain step decorator')
    def plain_step(step_counter):
      step_counter['step'] += 1

    # Step with "Given" keyword could be bounded to step decorated with "given" definition
    @given('Step is executed by given step decorator')
    def given_step(step_counter):
      step_counter['given'] += 1

    # Same as "given"
    @when('Step is executed by when step decorator')
    def when_step(step_counter):
      step_counter['when'] += 1

    # Same as "given"
    @then('Step is executed by then step decorator')
    def then_step(step_counter):
      step_counter['then'] += 1

    @then('there are passed steps by kind:')
    def check_step_counter(step, step_counter):
      # Step datatables data could be accessed in the next manner
      step_data_table = step.data_table
      oracle_results_header = [cell.value for cell in step_data_table.rows[0].cells]
      oracle_results_values = [int(cell.value) for cell in step_data_table.rows[1].cells]
      oracle_result = dict(zip(oracle_results_header, oracle_results_values))

      assert oracle_result == step_counter
    ```
* When run pytest
* Then pytest outcome must contain tests with statuses:
    | passed |
    |--------|
    | 1      |

## Scenario: Steps could be executed by aliased step keyword decorator
    Could be useful to declare the same fixtures or steps with
    different names for better readability. In order to use the same step
    function with multiple step names simply decorate it multiple times.
* Given File "steps.feature" with content:
    ```gherkin
    Feature: Steps could be executed by aliased step keyword decorator
      Scenario:
          Given Step counter

          * Step is executed by aliased step decorator
          Given Step is executed by aliased step decorator
          When Step is executed by aliased step decorator
          Then Step is executed by aliased step decorator

          Then there are "4" passed aliased steps
    ```
* And File "conftest.py" with content:
    ```python
    from pytest_bdd import given, when, then, step

    @given('Step counter', target_fixture='step_counter')
    def step_counter():
      yield {'steps_count': 0}

    @step('Step is executed by aliased step decorator')
    @given('Step is executed by aliased step decorator')
    @when('Step is executed by aliased step decorator')
    @then('Step is executed by aliased step decorator')
    def aliased_step(step_counter):
      step_counter['steps_count'] += 1

    @then(
      'there are "{int}" passed aliased steps',
      anonymous_group_names=('oracle_steps',),
    )
    def then_step(step_counter, oracle_steps):
      assert step_counter['steps_count'] == oracle_steps
    ```
* When run pytest
* Then pytest outcome must contain tests with statuses:
    | passed |
    |--------|
    | 1      |

## Rule: Steps could be executed by liberal step keyword decorator
    Step definition decorator could be "liberal"
    - so it could be bound to any kind of keyword
### Background:
* Given File "steps.feature" with content:
    ```gherkin
    Feature: Steps could be executed by liberal step keyword decorator
      Scenario:
        Given Step counter

        * Step is executed by liberal step decorator
        Given Step is executed by liberal step decorator
        When Step is executed by liberal step decorator
        Then Step is executed by liberal step decorator

        * Step is executed by liberal given decorator
        Given Step is executed by liberal given decorator
        When Step is executed by liberal given decorator
        Then Step is executed by liberal given decorator

        * Step is executed by liberal when decorator
        Given Step is executed by liberal when decorator
        When Step is executed by liberal when decorator
        Then Step is executed by liberal when decorator

        * Step is executed by liberal then decorator
        Given Step is executed by liberal then decorator
        When Step is executed by liberal then decorator
        Then Step is executed by liberal then decorator

        Then there are "16" passed liberal steps
    ```

### Scenario: Same step is used with different keywords
* Given File "conftest.py" with content:
    ```python
    from pytest_bdd import given, when, then, step

    @given('Step counter', target_fixture='step_counter')
    def step_counter():
      yield {'steps_count': 0}

    @step('Step is executed by liberal step decorator', liberal=True)
    @given('Step is executed by liberal given decorator', liberal=True)
    @when('Step is executed by liberal when decorator', liberal=True)
    @then('Step is executed by liberal then decorator', liberal=True)
    def liberal_step(step_counter):
      step_counter['steps_count'] += 1

    @then(
      'there are "{int}" passed liberal steps',
      anonymous_group_names=('oracle_steps',),
    )
    def then_step(step_counter, oracle_steps):
      assert step_counter['steps_count'] == oracle_steps
    ```
* When run pytest
* Then pytest outcome must contain tests with statuses:
    | passed |
    |--------|
    | 1      |

### Scenario: Keyworded steps could be treated as liberal by pytest command line option
* Given File "conftest.py" with content:
    ```python
    from pytest_bdd import given, when, then, step

    @given('Step counter', target_fixture='step_counter')
    def step_counter():
      yield {'steps_count': 0}

    @step('Step is executed by liberal step decorator')
    @given('Step is executed by liberal given decorator')
    @when('Step is executed by liberal when decorator')
    @then('Step is executed by liberal then decorator')
    def liberal_step(step_counter):
      step_counter['steps_count'] += 1

    @then(
      'there are "{int}" passed liberal steps',
      anonymous_group_names=('oracle_steps',),
    )
    def then_step(step_counter, oracle_steps):
      assert step_counter['steps_count'] == oracle_steps
    ```
* When run pytest
    | cli_args | --liberal-steps |
    |----------|-----------------|

* Then pytest outcome must contain tests with statuses:
    | passed | failed |
    |--------|--------|
    | 1      | 0      |
