# Feature: Descriptions
  Free-form descriptions can be placed underneath Feature, Example/Scenario, Background, Scenario Outline and Rule.
  You can write anything you like, as long as no line starts with a keyword.
  Descriptions can be in the form of Markdown - formatters including the official HTML formatter support this.

## Scenario:
* Given File "Description.feature" with content:
    ```gherkin
    Feature:
      My Feature description
      Scenario:
        Given I check feature description
    ```
* And File "conftest.py" with content:
    ```python
    from pytest_bdd import given

    @given('I check feature description')
    def step(feature):
      assert feature.description == "My Feature description"
    ```
* When run pytest
* Then pytest outcome must contain tests with statuses:
    | passed | failed |
    |--------|--------|
    | 1      | 0      |
