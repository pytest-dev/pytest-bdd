# Feature: Gherkin features load by scenario and scenarios functions
## Background:
* Given File "Passing.feature" in the temporary path with content:
    ```gherkin
    Feature: Passing feature
      Scenario: Passing scenario
        Given Passing step
    ```
* And File "conftest.py" with content:
    ```python
    from pytest_bdd import step

    @step('Passing step')
    def _():
      ...
    ```
## Scenario: "scenario" function is used as decorator
* And File "test_scenario_load.py" with fixture templated content:
    ```python
    from pytest_bdd import scenario
    from pathlib import Path

    @scenario(Path(r"{tmp_path}") / "Passing.feature")
    def test_passing_feature():
      # It is however encouraged to try as much as possible to have your logic only inside the Given, When, Then steps.
      ...
    ```

## Scenario: "scenarios" function is used as decorator
* And File "test_scenario_load.py" with fixture templated content:
    ```python
    from pytest_bdd import scenarios
    from pathlib import Path

    @scenarios(Path(r"{tmp_path}") / "Passing.feature", return_test_decorator=True)
    def test_passing_feature():
      # It is however encouraged to try as much as possible to have your logic only inside the Given, When, Then steps.
      ...
    ```
* When run pytest
* Then pytest outcome must contain tests with statuses:
    | passed |
    |--------|
    | 1      |

## Scenario: "scenario" function is used to register feature as test
* And File "test_scenario_load.py" with fixture templated content:
    ```python
    from pytest_bdd import scenario
    from pathlib import Path

    test_passing_feature = scenario(Path(r"{tmp_path}") / "Passing.feature", return_test_decorator=False)
    ```
* When run pytest
* Then pytest outcome must contain tests with statuses:
    | passed |
    |--------|
    | 1      |

## Scenario: "scenarios" function is used to register feature as test
* And File "test_scenario_load.py" with fixture templated content:
    ```python
    from pytest_bdd import scenarios
    from pathlib import Path

    test_passing_feature = scenarios(Path(r"{tmp_path}") / "Passing.feature")
    ```
* When run pytest
* Then pytest outcome must contain tests with statuses:
    | passed |
    |--------|
    | 1      |
