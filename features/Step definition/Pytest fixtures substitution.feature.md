# Feature: Step definition could use pytest fixtures as step parameters

  Test setup is implemented within the Given section. Even though these steps
  are executed imperatively to apply possible side-effects, pytest-bdd-ng is trying
  to benefit of the PyTest fixtures which is based on the dependency injection
  and makes the setup more declarative style.

  In pytest-bdd-ng you just declare an argument of the step function that it depends on
  and the PyTest will make sure to provide it.

## Scenario:

* Given File "conftest.py" with content:
    ```python
    from pytest import fixture
    from pytest_bdd import given, when, then

    @fixture
    def pocket():
      yield [{"cherry": "delicious"}]

    @given("I have an old pickle", param_defaults={"age": "old"}, target_fixture='pickle_age', params_fixtures_mapping=False)
    def i_have_cucumber(pocket):
        pocket.append({"age": "old", "cucumber": "pickle"})

    @when("I check pocket I found cucumber there")
    def i_check_pocket_for_cucumber(pocket):
      assert any(filter(lambda item: "cucumber" in item.keys(), pocket))

    @then("I lost everything")
    def i_check_pocket_for_cucumber(pocket):
      while pocket:
        pocket.pop()
    ```
* Given File "Cucumber.feature" with content:
    ```gherkin
    Feature:
      Scenario:
        Given I have an old pickle
        When I check pocket I found cucumber there
        Then I lost everything
    ```
* Given File "test_freshness.py" with content:
    ```python
    from pytest_bdd import scenario

    @scenario("Cucumber.feature")
    def test_passing_feature(pocket):
      assert not pocket
    ```
* When run pytest
    | cli_args | --disable-feature-autoload |
    |----------|----------------------------|

* Then pytest outcome must contain tests with statuses:
    | passed |
    |--------|
    | 1      |
