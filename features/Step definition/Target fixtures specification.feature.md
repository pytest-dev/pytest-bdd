# Feature: Step definition could override or setup new fixture
  Dependency injection is not a panacea if you have complex structure of your test setup data.
  Sometimes there's a need such a given step which would imperatively change
  the fixture only for certain test (scenario), while for other tests
  it will stay untouched. To allow this, special parameter `target_fixture` exists in the decorator:

## Scenario: Single fixture injection
* Given File "conftest.py" with content:
    ```python
    from pytest_bdd import given

    @given("I have an old pickle", param_defaults={"age": "old"}, target_fixture='pickle_age', params_fixtures_mapping=False)
    def i_have_cucumber(age):
        yield age
    ```
* Given File "Freshness.feature" with content:
    ```gherkin
    Feature:
      Scenario:
        Given I have an old pickle
    ```
* Given File "test_freshness.py" with content:
    ```python
    from pytest_bdd import scenario

    @scenario("Freshness.feature")
    def test_passing_feature(pickle_age, request):
      assert pickle_age == 'old'
      assert request.getfixturevalue('pickle_age') == pickle_age
    ```
* When run pytest
    | cli_args | --disable-feature-autoload |
    |----------|----------------------------|

* Then pytest outcome must contain tests with statuses:
    | passed |
    |--------|
    | 1      |

## Scenario: Multiple fixtures injection
* Given File "conftest.py" with content:
    ```python
    from pytest_bdd import given

    @given("I have an old pickle", target_fixtures=['pickle_age', 'cucumber_kind'])
    def i_have_cucumber():
        yield ['old', 'pickle']
    ```
* Given File "Freshness.feature" with content:
    ```gherkin
    Feature:
      Scenario:
        Given I have an old pickle
    ```
* Given File "test_freshness.py" with content:
    ```python
    from pytest_bdd import scenario

    @scenario("Freshness.feature")
    def test_passing_feature(request, pickle_age, cucumber_kind):
      assert pickle_age == 'old'
      assert cucumber_kind == 'pickle'
      assert request.getfixturevalue('pickle_age') == pickle_age
      assert request.getfixturevalue('cucumber_kind') == cucumber_kind
    ```
* When run pytest
    | cli_args | --disable-feature-autoload |
    |----------|----------------------------|

* Then pytest outcome must contain tests with statuses:
    | passed |
    |--------|
    | 1      |
