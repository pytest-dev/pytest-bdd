Security
++++++++


[8.0.0] - 2024-11-14
----------

Added
+++++
* Gherkin keyword aliases can now be used and correctly reported in json and terminal output (see `Keywords <https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#keywords>`_ for permitted list).
* Added localization support. The language of the feature file can be specified using the `# language: <language>` directive at the beginning of the file.
* Rule keyword can be used in feature files (see `Rule <https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#rule>`_)
* Added support for multiple example tables
* Added filtering by tags against example tables
* Since the 7.x series:
  * Tags can now be on multiple lines (stacked)
  * Continuation of steps using asterisks (``*``) instead of ``And``/``But`` supported.
  * Added ``datatable`` argument for steps that contain a datatable (see `Data Tables <https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#data-tables>`_).
  * Added ``docstring`` argument for steps that contain a docstring (see `Doc Strings <https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#doc-strings>`_).

Changed
+++++++
* Changelog format updated to follow `Keep a Changelog <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/>`_.
* Text after the ``#`` character is no longer stripped from the Scenario and Feature name.
* Since the 7.x series:

  * Use the `gherkin-official <https://pypi.org/project/gherkin-official/>`_ parser, replacing the custom parsing logic. This will make pytest-bdd more compatible with the Gherkin specification.
  * Multiline steps must now always use triple-quotes for the additional lines.
  * All feature files must now use the keyword ``Feature:`` to be considered valid.
  * Tags can no longer have spaces (e.g. ``@tag one`` and ``@tag two`` are no longer valid).
  * Text after the ``#`` character is no longer stripped from the Step name.
  * Multiline strings no longer match name based on multiple lines - only on the actual step text on the step line.

Removed
+++++++
* Dropped support for python 3.8. Supported python versions: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13.
* Since the 7.x series:

  * Drop compatibility with pytest < 7.0.0.

- Test against the latest versions of pytest (8.2, 8.3).

7.2.0
----------
- Fix compatibility issue with Python 3.13.
- Declare compatibility with Python 3.13.

7.1.2
----------
- Address another compatibility issue with pytest 8.1 (fixture registration). `#680 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/680>`_

7.1.1
----------
- Address a bug introduced in pytest-bdd 7.1 caused by incorrect pytest version check.

7.1
----------

7.0.0
----------
- ⚠️ Backwards incompatible: - ``parsers.re`` now does a `fullmatch <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.fullmatch>`_ instead of a partial match. This is to make it work just like the other parsers, since they don't ignore non-matching characters at the end of the string. `#539 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/539>`_
- Drop python 3.7 compatibility, as it's no longer supported. `#627 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/627>`_

- Add support for Scenarios and Scenario Outlines to have descriptions. `#600 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/600>`_

6.1.1
-----
- Fix regression introduced in version 6.1.0 where the ``pytest_bdd_after_scenario`` hook would be called after every step instead of after the scenario. `#577 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/577>`_

6.1.0
-----
- Fix bug where steps without parsers would take precedence over steps with parsers. `#534 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/534>`_
- Step functions can now be decorated multiple times with @given, @when, @then. Previously every decorator would override ``converters`` and ``target_fixture`` every at every application. `#534 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/534>`_ `#544 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/544>`_ `#525 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/issues/525>`_
- Require pytest>=6.2 `#534 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/534>`_
- Using modern way to specify hook options to avoid deprecation warnings with pytest >=7.2.
- Add generic ``step`` decorator that will be used for all kind of steps `#548 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/548>`_
- Add ``stacklevel`` param to ``given``, ``when``, ``then``, ``step`` decorators. This allows for programmatic step generation `#548 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/548>`_
- Hide pytest-bdd internal method in user tracebacks `#557 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/557>`_.
- Make the package PEP 561-compatible `#559 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/issues/559>`_ `#563 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/563>`_.
- Configuration option ``bdd_features_base_dir`` is interpreted as relative to the `pytest root directory <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/customize.html#rootdir>`_ (previously it was relative to the current working directory). `#573 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/573>`_


6.0.1
-----
- Fix regression introduced in 6.0.0 where a step function decorated multiple using a parsers times would not be executed correctly. `#530 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/530>`_ `#528 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/issues/528>`_


6.0.0
-----

This release introduces breaking changes in order to be more in line with the official gherkin specification.

- Cleanup of the documentation and tests related to parametrization (elchupanebrej) `#469 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/469>`_
- Removed feature level examples for the gherkin compatibility (olegpidsadnyi) `#490 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/490>`_
- Removed vertical examples for the gherkin compatibility (olegpidsadnyi) `#492 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/492>`_
- Step arguments are no longer fixtures (olegpidsadnyi) `#493 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/493>`_
- Drop support of python 3.6, pytest 4 (elchupanebrej) `#495 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/495>`_ `#504 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/issues/504>`_
- Step definitions can have "yield" statements again (4.0 release broke it). They will be executed as normal fixtures: code after the yield is executed during teardown of the test. (youtux) `#503 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/issues/503>`_
- Scenario outlines unused example parameter validation is removed (olegpidsadnyi) `#499 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/499>`_
- Add type annotations (youtux) `#505 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/505>`_
- ``pytest_bdd.parsers.StepParser`` now is an Abstract Base Class. Subclasses must make sure to implement the abstract methods. (youtux) `#505 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/505>`_
- Angular brackets in step definitions are only parsed in "Scenario Outline" (previously they were parsed also in normal "Scenario"s) (youtux) `#524 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/524>`_.



5.0.0
-----
This release introduces breaking changes, please refer to the :ref:`Migration from 4.x.x`.

- Rewrite the logic to parse Examples for Scenario Outlines. Now the substitution of the examples is done during the parsing of Gherkin feature files. You won't need to define the steps twice like ``@given("there are <start> cucumbers")`` and ``@given(parsers.parse("there are {start} cucumbers"))``. The latter will be enough.
- Removed ``example_converters`` from ``scenario(...)`` signature. You should now use just the ``converters`` parameter for ``given``, ``when``, ``then``.
- Removed ``--cucumberjson-expanded`` and ``--cucumber-json-expanded`` options. Now the JSON report is always expanded.
- Removed ``--gherkin-terminal-reporter-expanded`` option. Now the terminal report is always expanded.

4.1.0
-----------
- `when` and `then` steps now can provide a `target_fixture`, just like `given` does. Discussion at https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/issues/402.
- Drop compatibility for python 2 and officially support only python >= 3.6.
