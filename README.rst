pytest-bdd implements a subset of Gherkin language for the automation of the project
requirements testing and easier behavioral driven development.

Unlike many other BDD tools it doesn't require a separate runner and benefits from
the power and flexibility of the pytest. It allows to unify your unit and functional
tests, easier continuous integration server configuration and maximal reuse of the
tests setup.

Pytest fixtures written for the unit tests can be reused for the setup and actions
mentioned in the feature steps with dependency injection, which allows a true BDD
just-enough specification of the requirements without maintaining any context object
containing the side effects of the Gherkin imperative declarations.

Install pytest-bdd
==================

::

    pip install pytest-bdd

Example
=======

publish\_article.feature:

::

    Scenario: Publishing the article
        Given I'm an author user
        And I have an article
        When I go to the article page
        And I press the publish button
        Then I should not see the error message
        And the article should be published  # Note: will query the database

test\_publish\_article.py:

::

    from pytest_bdd import scenario, given, when, then

    test_publish = scenario('publish_article.feature', 'Publishing the article')


    @given('I have an article')
    def article(author):
        return create_test_article(author=author)


    @when('I go to the article page')
    def go_to_article(article, browser):
        browser.visit(urljoin(browser.url, '/manage/articles/{0}/'.format(article.id)))


    @when('I press the publish button')
    def publish_article(browser):
        browser.find_by_css('button[name=publish]').first.click()


    @then('I should not see the error message')
    def no_error_message(browser):
        with pytest.raises(ElementDoesNotExist):
            browser.find_by_css('.message.error').first


    @then('And the article should be published')
    def article_is_published(article):
        article.refresh()  # Refresh the object in the SQLAlchemy session
        assert article.is_published

Step aliases
============

Sometimes it is needed to declare the same fixtures or steps with the
different names for better readability. In order to use the same step
function with multiple step names simply decorate it multiple times:

::

    @given('I have an article')
    @given('there\'s an article')
    def article(author):
        return create_test_article(author=author)

Note that the given step aliases are independent and will be executed
when mentioned.

For example if you associate your resource to some owner or not. Admin
user can’t be an author of the article, but articles should have a
default author.

::

    Scenario: I'm the author
        Given I'm an author
        And I have an article


    Scenario: I'm the admin
        Given I'm the admin
        And there is an article

Step parameters
===============

Scenarios can be parametrized to cover few cases. In Gherkin the variable
templates are written using corner braces as <somevalue>.

Example:

::

    Scenario: Parametrized given, when, thens
        Given there are <start> cucumbers
        When I eat <eat> cucumbers
        Then I should have <left> cucumbers

Unlike other tools, pytest-bdd implements the scenario outline not in the
feature files, but in the python code using pytest parametrization.
The reason for this is that it is very often that some simple pythonic type
is needed in the parameters like a datetime or a dictionary, which makes it
more difficult to express in the text files and preserve the correct format.

The code will look like:

::

    # Here we use pytest to parametrize the test with the parameters table
    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        ['start', 'eat', 'left'],
        [(12, 5, 7)])
    @scenario(
        'parametrized.feature',
        'Parametrized given, when, thens',
    )
    # Note that we should take the same arguments in the test function that we use
    # for the test parametrization either directly or indirectly (fixtures depend on them).
    def test_parametrized(start, eat, left):
        """We don't need to do anything here, everything will be managed by the scenario decorator."""


    @given('there are <start> cucumbers')
    def start_cucumbers(start):
        return dict(start=start)


    @when('I eat <eat> cucumbers')
    def eat_cucumbers(start_cucumbers, start, eat):
        start_cucumbers['eat'] = eat


    @then('I should have <left> cucumbers')
    def should_have_left_cucumbers(start_cucumbers, start, eat, left):
        assert start - eat == left
        assert start_cucumbers['start'] == start
        assert start_cucumbers['eat'] == eat

Reuse fixtures
==============

Sometimes scenarios define new names for the fixture that can be
inherited. Fixtures can be reused with other names using given():

::

    given('I have beautiful article', fixture='article')

Reuse steps
===========

It is possible to define some common steps in the parent conftest.py and
simply expect them in the child test file.

common\_steps.feature:

::

    Scenario: All steps are declared in the conftest
        Given I have a bar
        Then bar should have value "bar"

conftest.py:

::

    from pytest_bdd import given, then


    @given('I have a bar')
    def bar():
        return 'bar'


    @then('bar should have value "bar"')
    def bar_is_bar(bar):
        assert bar == 'bar'

test\_common.py:

::

    test_conftest = scenario('common_steps.feature', 'All steps are declared in the conftest')

There are no definitions of the steps in the test file. They were
collected from the parent conftests.

Feature file paths
==================

But default, pytest-bdd will use current module’s path as base path for
finding feature files, but this behaviour can be changed by having
fixture named ‘pytestbdd\_feature\_base\_dir’ which should return the
new base path.

test\_publish\_article.py:

::

    import pytest
    from pytest_bdd import scenario


    @pytest.fixture
    def pytestbdd_feature_base_dir():
        return '/home/user/projects/foo.bar/features'

    test_publish = scenario('publish_article.feature', 'Publishing the article')


Feature file fixture
====================

Instead of specifiying the feature file over and over again in a certain testfile, you can also create a fixture which does that for you. 
The path you return here will be appended to the pytestbdd_feature_base_dir, which is explained above.
Examples make everything better:

::

    import pytest
    from pytest_bdd import scenario


    @pytest.fixture
    def pytestbdd_feature_file():
        return "publish_article.feature"

    test_publish = scenario("Publishing the article")


This example will use the 'publish_article.feature' file for all scenarios in the file which do not have a feature file explicitly specified.


Subplugins
==========

The pytest BDD has plugin support, and the main purpose of plugins
(subplugins) is to provide useful and specialized fixtures.

List of known subplugins:

::

    *  pytest-bdd-splinter -- collection of fixtures for the real browser BDD testing
